# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 
    the way the end product is way and how much others are involve
2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?
    we use trello for communication and see who got what done.
3. What role did you take on in the project? 
    more like the one who just do whatever it takes for the least amount of drama
4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
    use trello more or something like that because it made this project so much  organize
5. How does retro function in a team project?
    everyday at the end of the day we come together to see how we can approve on our project
6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?
    it was more like how we can improve as a group rather then individual so no one got targetnwhich i like.
7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
    im a guy with few worlds and not very open when talking so i see how communication help the project progress
